        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to the Test Demo extension ("the Extension," "we," "us," or "our"). We understand the importance of privacy to you and are committed to respecting and protecting it.
        </p>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy ("the Policy") is intended to clearly explain how we handle information when you use the Extension. Please read and fully understand this Policy before using the Extension. By starting to use the Extension, you signify that you have understood and agreed to this Policy.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            We solemnly swear that <strong>we DO NOT collect, store, or transmit any of your personal information or sensitive data.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The core function of the Extension is to display basic information about the web page you are currently viewing. To achieve this, the Extension needs to access the following non-personal information from your active tab: Web page address (URL), Web page title (Title), Current system time.
        </p>
        <p>
            This information is <strong>used solely for the purpose of immediate display</strong> within the Extension's user interface. It is processed entirely within your local browser, <strong>is not saved, and is never sent to our servers or any third-party servers</strong>. The display of this information ceases when you close the Extension's interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not collect your IP address, Browse history, cookies, personally identifiable information (such as name, email address), or any other data related to you personally.
        </p>


        <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>
            Since we do not collect any information, we do not use any information for any purpose other than the core functionality, such as advertising, analytics, or user profiling. The sole use of the information is to display the current page's address, title, and time to you when you actively invoke the Extension.
        </p>


        <h2>3. How We Store and Protect Information</h2>
        <p>
            The Extension does not include any data storage capabilities. All operations are real-time and transient. Since we do not collect or store any of your information, there is no situation requiring data storage or protection. All your data remains securely on your own device.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Sharing, Transfer, and Public Disclosure of Information</h2>
        <p>
            We promise that we will never share, transfer, or publicly disclose any information to any company, organization, or individual, as we do not collect any information at all.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
            You have complete control over your own data. Since we do not hold any of your data, you do not need to exercise rights such as access, correction, or deletion. If you wish to stop the Extension's functionality, you can simply disable or uninstall it from your browser's extension management page.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy. If any changes are made to this Policy, we will post the new version on this page and update the "Last Updated" date. We advise you to review this page periodically for any changes.
